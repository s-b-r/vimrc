vimrc
=====

My options for vim. 

Most of these plugins install automatically, some need a little extra setup.
If a plugin doesn't work (yet or at all) you should comment it out.

Also with Vim, use Ctags!
To generate ctags, enter following at command line:

"$ ctags -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q . "

highlight variables: space-]
highlight a specific word: space-m
reset highlights: space-M
